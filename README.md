# trempo.github.io
A personal web page for displaying who I am and the projects I've worked on.

The website is divided in 4 sections:
* Start, where my social media links are and a brief description about myself.
* Installed Libraries, a list of the technologies, frameworks and languages I'm comfortable with including a short description about them if you click on them.
* Projects, the personal projects I've worked on and currently work on.
* About me, information about me, my work experience and my academic background.

The website can be found on [here](https://trempo.github.io/).
